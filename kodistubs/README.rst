Kodistubs
=========
**(former xbmcstubs)**
----------------------

Kodi stubs are Python files that can help you develop addons for `Kodi (XBMC)`_ Media Center.
Use them in your favorite IDE to enable autocompletion and view docstrings
for Kodi Python API functions, classes and methods.

Read `Kodi stubs documentation`_ for more info on how to use Kodi stubs.

**Warning**: Kodistubs are literally stubs and do not include any useful code,
so don't try to run your program outside Kodi unless you add some testing code into Kodistubs
or use some mocking library to mock Kodi Pyhton API.

**Note**: I try to keep Kodi stubs in sync with Kodi Python API development, but it may happen
that I miss something. Don't hesitate to open issues or submit pull requests if you notice
discrepancies with the actual state of Kodi Python API.
